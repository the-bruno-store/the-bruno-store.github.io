# How to contribute

If you have a issue you want to share with me, please see the [issues tab]([https://github.com/Brunozhon/Brunozhon.github.io/issues](https://github.com/the-bruno-store/the-bruno-store.github.io/issues)).

## Issues

In the issues tab, you can...

- Create issues that a person can fix
- Ask a question about a issue
- Share opinions about what should be fixed

### WARNING!

There are some notes about the things above:

- Verify that the issue exists before creating it and the opinion's "main idea" exists 
- The questioned thing must exist, otherwise you might confuse someone
- The fixed thing must follow the coding langnge's syntax, otherwise you will create issues instead of fixing them

## Forking

Tip: After forking, you can give someone a pull reqeust

Click on the fork button to fork this respotory.

Wait for the forking magic, and when it is finshed, you have a copy. You can  inprove the file's content, fix typos, study about me in my webpage and add the studied stuff to the file, or anything you want to fix or inporve.

After you are finshed, click "Compare and Pull Reqeust".

Type a descriptive description including:

- I added... and then what you added
- I fixed... and then what you fixed
- I deleted... and then what you deleted
- Why you added, fixed, or deleted the stuff

The owner (which is me, Brunozhon), will "rank" the stuff.

- If the owner is busy, he will not merge your changes
- If you did not type the discrptive descpiption or typed very little description, he will probably reject it because he needs more info
- If you typed a description which contains I added.. and the what you added, I fixed... and then what you fixed, I deleted... and then what you deleted, and/or why you added, fixed and/or deleted stuff, the owner will problaay merge the changes
